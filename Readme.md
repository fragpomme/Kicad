# What is it ?

Here we store our homemade footprints and 3dshapes for Kicad

# How do I use it ?

You have to download two folders :

	PJ_Components.3dshapes and place it in Kicad/share/kicad/modules/packages3d/
	PJ_Footprints.pretty and place it where you want
	
For now it's not possible to use it directly from our git :/

# How do I contribute ?

You can add your footprints in the PJ_Components.pretty folder.

If there is any 3d shapes (.wrl), put it in the PJ_Components.3dshapes folder.

If there is any drawings, put your .pdf file in the Drawings folder.

## 3D Shapes

A lot of 3d shapes can be found for free on [Traceparts](http://www.tracepartsonline.net/ "http://www.tracepartsonline.net/") but also on Digi-Key. 

Because Kicad only accepts vrml files (.wrl), the use of a CAD software to convert the file (eg : FreeCAD) could be necessary.
